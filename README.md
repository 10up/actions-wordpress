# GitHub Actions for WordPress!

Here is a collection of GitHub Actions to help with common needs for WordPress development. Specific documentation for each Action is in the `README.md` file in its subdirectory.

## Ready to use
### [Deploying a plugin to the WordPress.org repository](dotorg-plugin-deploy)

Whenever you tag a new version of your plugin on GitHub, your changes will be committed to both `trunk` and the appropriate `tags` subfolder in your WordPress.org plugin repository.

## Planned
* Building a production-ready version into a `stable` branch or other location of choice.

## Ideas
* Generate hook docs into a Markdown file that can be published into a subfolder, GitHub wiki, and/or `gh-pages` branch.
