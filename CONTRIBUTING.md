# Contributing and Maintaining

First, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributors as well as information and instructions around our maintenance process. The two are closely tied together in terms of how we all work together and set expectations, so while you may not need to know everything in here to submit an issue or pull request, it's best to keep them in the same document.

## Ways to contribute

Contributing isn't just writing code - it's anything that improves the project. All contributions for our GitHub Actions for WordPress are managed right here on GitHub. Here are some ways you can help:

### Reporting bugs and requesting enhancements

If you're running into a problem with an action or would like to see it do something more, please open an issue in the repository for that specific action.

### Suggesting new actions

Ideas for future actions can be found in [issues](https://github.com/10up/actions-wordpress/issues).

### Pull requests

Pull requests will likely be uncommon but are welcomed as necessary!

## Workflow

This repository currently only actively uses the `master` branch as it is meant to serve as a documentation source. The Action subdirectories in this repository are kept for historical reasons.
